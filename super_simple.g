This is a simple grammar to get started with, since it is so small.

{
<start>
The <object> <verb> on the <object>!
}

{
<object>
cat
dog
mouse
}

Outside of the braces, there can be any kind of text; for comments, diagrams, etc.  You should skip over all this text and read the next nonterminal definition.

{
<verb>
sat
stood
}
